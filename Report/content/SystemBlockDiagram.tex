\section{System Block Diagram}
\label{sec:System Block Diagram}

Figure \ref{fig:systemBlockDiagram} shows the system block diagram that was implemented for this project. 
It has been split into subsections each serving a particular function.
The 8-Bit digital output of the system is sent to the microcontroller at the bottom right of the diagram.
